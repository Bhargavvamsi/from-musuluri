# Bhargav Vamsi Musuluri

"Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift features the enchanting encounter between Lemuel Gulliver and the Lilliputians, a miniature society where Gulliver becomes a giant among six-inch-tall inhabitants. Swift's satire shines as he uses this fantastical setting to cleverly critique human behavior and political absurdities.
